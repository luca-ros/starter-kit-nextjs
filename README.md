# Next.js Eslint Prettier

This is a basic [Next.js] app with Eslint and Prittier dependency configured.

This will format and autofix code, based on Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide [https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/]

## Download & Install dependencies

First, clone or download the ripository and install dependecies on your project by typing in your terminal:

**npm i**

## Start server

Second, run the development server:

**npm run dev**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
